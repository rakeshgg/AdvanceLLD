# objective

- what design patetrn, type and classification

# Design pattern

- DP is common solution to common problems in programing
- It is a decription or templates for how to solve a problems that can be
  used in many different situations.
- Design pattern is used to make code more organized maintainable, extensible
  flexible and scalable.
- also make easier to developer to communicate with complex system
- Dp is not programing dependent
  Creational, Stuctural, Behavioural

# Creational

Factory
Abstract Factory
Builder
Prototype
Sigelton
Object Pool

# stuctural

Adaptive
Bridge
Composite
Decorator
Facade
Flyweight
Proxy

# Behavioural

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Observer
- State
- Starategy
- Visitors
- Template methods

# Use of Design pattern

- Reusability
- Flexibility : adopt wide range of situation
- Maintainability
- Reducing complexity - breaking smaller and managable part
- used in
- oops
- Large Scale system
- software developemnts
- Dp is not always the best solution for every problems, act as a guide to solve
  particular problems

# cavaet

- Overuse : inappropriate solution
- rigidity : prevent dev from thinking
- Difficulty of understaing of dp
- ExtraComplexity

# Creational Patterns

Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
Builder: Separates object construction from its representation
Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes
Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
Singleton: A class in which only a single instance can exist
Note: The best way to remember Creational Pattern is by remembering ABFPS (Abraham Became First President of States).

# Structural Patterns

Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
Bridge: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation
Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
Façade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
Proxy: An object representing another object

Note: To remember Structural Pattern best is (ABCDFFP) -> ABCDF2P

# Behavioral Patterns

Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes
Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
Chain of Resp: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
State: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
Template Method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change
